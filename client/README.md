## Goals
The main goals of this project is to expose you to what it's like to work on a real-world project. Assume that you are working on a team with other developers and that you are building a product for a client. In this case, you'll be building a mock ecommerce site for a client that sells a variety of products. The client has provided you with a list of requirements for the project, but you will need to make some decisions on your own. You will also need to make sure that your code is well organized and documented so that other developers can easily understand and work with your code.
